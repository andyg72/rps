#Rock Paper Scissors
##Makers Academy Weekly Challenge - Week 3

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

As always you can use google your notes and everything else. This is a challenge for you and you only!

##Andy's Notes

Completed all levels of the challenge.

To play, rackup and go to localhost suggested by rackup.

Following code review I;
- implemented layout and partials to improve readability of the code associated with the html
- moved to image input of choices from text based (reduces error opportunity and makes it more playable)
