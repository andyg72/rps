###To play the game locally
Clone this repository
From command line, within the root of the project directory `$ rackup`. This will start the server.
Then in browser open [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

###To run the tests
From the command line, within the root of the directory;
Unit Tests (Rspec) `$ rspec`
Feature Tests (Cucumber / Capybara) `$ cucumber`

###Learning points
- separation of flow control / game logic between controller (rps.rb) and backend code (game.rb)
- layout file to manage overall html formatting
- minimising session variables
- use of partials to make client side code more readable

###What more I would do
- improve front end display formatting, especially where optional fields are not returned, to improve consistency of user experience.

### Requirements of the challenge - by Makers Academy

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them.
